# Hyperparameter-Tuning

1. Using the high utilization data, optimize hyperparameters for Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and another selected learning method. For each of the method, search through values of at least three different hyperparameters.\

2. Plot model AUC and accuracy on training and testing data for different values of lambda (C) in L1 regularized logistic regression.
